# Pixel-Crafter
PixelCrafter is a deep learning project that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate high-quality synthetic images from random noise. The project demonstrates the creative potential of neural networks in image generation and highlights the power of GANs in producing realistic and visually appealing outputs.
